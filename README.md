<div class="Work">
<h2 align="left">üìå What was the request? </h2>

- The implementation was developed to meet a request from the production department, where the requester needed to obtain information from the MyLims application to send it to another application called Pims..

- A study was initiated to understand the best ways to perform this "integration". Over time, we found that MyLims already had this integration ready, but it is not included in our license.

<div class="Funcionality">
<H1 align="center">‚öôÔ∏è Functionality of the script </H1>

- `Feature 1`: Makes the request to the API provided by MyLims.
- `Feature 2`: Fetches and processes the data received from the request.
- `Feature 3`: After making the request and processing the received data, the data is sent. para o Pims. 

</br>

<H1 align="center">üìå About the script </H1>

- `Regarding 1`: It was developed in PowerShell, due to the SDK for developing with o Pims.
- `Regarding 2`: It uses the library from PySystem-Osisoft.
- `Regarding 3`: After finishing the implementation, a routine was createdin a VirtualMachine to run every 01:00.
